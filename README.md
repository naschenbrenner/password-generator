########Personal Notes##########
This was done for the Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path training. I opted to do the stretch goals of:

Ability to set password length
Add copy-on-click
Toggle "symbols" and "numbers" on/off 

Copy-on-click & Toggle "symbols" and "numbers" on/off turned out to be a lot more challanging than I thought but I'm glad I stuck with it and got them working as I think they look quite nice.
